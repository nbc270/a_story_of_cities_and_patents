The magnetic securing devices are formed of plastic tabs movable laterally with respect to each other, one tab having an embedded magnet and the other having a magnetizable slug embedded in it. The napkin holder may be supplied with at least one napkin to be used with it in a package designed to provide an immediately usable combination product.   \n",
       "1  The bib of the present invention has a collar and a chest-covering fabric extending from and attached to the collar. The collar is a resilient, generally C-shaped, flat plastic ring that is disposed within a sleeve. The fabric is attached to the lower end of the sleeve and it covers a user's chest to protect the user's clothes from food stains and spills. Consequently, the bib covers the user's chest while being retained about the neck by the resilient collar, eliminating the need for reaching behind the neck to fasten and unfasten the bib. The bib is suitable for user's of any age, and is particularly well adapted for use by the elderly, the disabled, and small toddlers. The chest cover may have any desired shape or color, and may have indicia thereon.   \n",

The strips generally comprise a liquid permeable outer sheet, an absorbent medium, and a backsheet. Applied to the backsheet can be a fastening adhesive. A peel sheet can be attached to the backsheet that can be removed immediately prior to attaching the strip on a article. Other embodiments include attaching multi-use strip to a Velcro strip. In addition, embodiments include the distribution of a roll of material that can be cut to a desired length or provided in pre-cut stacks of the absorbent strips.   \n",

Too many articles in the care and handling of infants have been found to be a danger to the infant and in some cases have caused fatalities of infants even with very attentive parents. When we purchase an article designed for children we assume it is safe, but it has been proven that many are not. Safety in the design of devices in the field of childcare must be of the utmost importance.   \n",

The braided surfaces provide a function, since they allow the garment to be form fitting and stretchably conform to the size and shape of the wearer. The braid also results in an attractive and decorative clothing design. The braid is accomplished easily and simply by cutting a plurality of slits in the outer surfaces of the garment and threading the adjacent resulting loop segments which ultimately form the braid.   \n",

       "1  The bib of the present invention has a collar and a chest-covering fabric extending from and attached to the collar. The collar is a resilient, generally C-shaped, flat plastic ring that is disposed within a sleeve. The fabric is attached to the lower end of the sleeve and it covers a user's chest to protect the user's clothes from food stains and spills. Consequently, the bib covers the user's chest while being retained about the neck by the resilient collar, eliminating the need for reaching behind the neck to fasten and unfasten the bib. The bib is suitable for user's of any age, and is particularly well adapted for use by the elderly, the disabled, and small toddlers. The chest cover may have any desired shape or color, and may have indicia thereon.   \n",

A peel sheet can be attached to the backsheet that can be removed immediately prior to attaching the strip on a article. Other embodiments include attaching multi-use strip to a Velcro strip. In addition, embodiments include the distribution of a roll of material that can be cut to a desired length or provided in pre-cut stacks of the absorbent strips.   \n",

Too many articles in the care and handling of infants have been found to be a danger to the infant and in some cases have caused fatalities of infants even with very attentive parents. When we purchase an article designed for children we assume it is safe, but it has been proven that many are not. Safety in the design of devices in the field of childcare must be of the utmost importance.   \n",

An estimated 1.1 billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water. This is a global problem. The purpose of our research is to develop a self-sustaining and an inexpensive reactor that will rid the naturally available water from a wide variety of contaminants and pathogens, making it suitable for human consumption.  \n",
       "4  To sustainably meet the energy needs of Trishul, a tribal village in the Narmada River Valley in Maharashtra, India, by using locally available materials, integrating different renewable energy systems, and designing environmentally-benign and locally appropriate energy storage options. The energy system must provide the following energy services to the 1400 inhabitants of Trishul: 4-5 hours of light per family per night; 1 refrigerator for the village to store vital vaccines; electricity for water pumping and irrigation; and more environmentally-friendly methods of cooking. The project addresses four aspects of sustainability for developing nations: (1) appropriate technology, (2) ecosystem sustainability, (3) environmental sustainability, and (4) socio-economic sustainability.  \n",

The energy system must provide the following energy services to the 1400 inhabitants of Trishul: 4-5 hours of light per family per night; 1 refrigerator for the village to store vital vaccines; electricity for water pumping and irrigation; and more environmentally-friendly methods of cooking. The project addresses four aspects of sustainability for developing nations: (1) appropriate technology, (2) ecosystem sustainability, (3) environmental sustainability, and (4) socio-economic sustainability.   \n",
