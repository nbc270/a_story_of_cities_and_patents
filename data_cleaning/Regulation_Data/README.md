For regulation data, we are using three data which are from Federal Funding, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program and Empowerment Zone (EZ) Program. Federal funding and SBIR program data are available from websites mentioned below and need to be downloaded manually as there isn't appropriate api call to get our desired data. EZ data are obtained from a report* by General Accounting Office and has been cleaned into a downloadable csv file called EZs.csv in 'Empowerment_Zone' folder. There is also a csv file called EZ_raw.csv which has exact same 

Follow the steps below to produce desired data:

1. Federal Funding Data

a) In 'Federal_Funding' folder, create a folder named 'byCity'

b) Go to: https://www.usaspending.gov/#/download_center/custom_award_data \
For each year (2001 to 2012), fill in options as following and click download:

Award level: Prime Awards \

c) For each year: unzip the downloaded folder and change its name to year (eg. 2001)
